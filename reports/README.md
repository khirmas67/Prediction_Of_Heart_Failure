   This folder contains visualizations generated during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and experimentation phase. These visuals are used for testing ideas, identifying patterns, and refining models.

2. **final_visualizations**:  
   This folder stores finalized and polished visualizations intended for reports, presentations. These visuals represent the key findings and conclusions of the project.

3. The `results.txt` file contains a detailed evaluation summary of all trained machine learning models. It includes the following:
      ```
    - Model Performance Metrics:
      For each model (e.g., Neural Network, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest), the file provides the following metrics:
        Accuracy
        Precision
        Recall
        AUC-ROC (if applicable)
        Confusion Matrix

    - Best Model Summary:
      A separate section highlights the best-performing model based on accuracy, along with its detailed metrics and confusion matrix.
      ```

4. This folder includes a pdf file of the final report on the Prediction of Heart Failure project.
