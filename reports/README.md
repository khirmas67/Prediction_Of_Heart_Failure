# Reports Folder

This folder contains visualizations and graphical outputs generated during the project. These visualizations provide insights into the data and the results of various models.

## Structure

- **Visualization Files**: Images or plots created using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or any other visualization library.
- **Subfolders (Optional)**: If the visualizations are organized by type or stage of analysis, subfolders can be added.

## Purpose

The visualizations in this folder are intended to:

- Summarize key insights from the data.
- Highlight the performance of models.
- Support decision-making with clear graphical representations.

## Notes

- Ensure all visualizations are clearly labeled with meaningful titles and file names.
- If applicable, include a description of each visualization in a separate document or as comments in the code that generates them.
