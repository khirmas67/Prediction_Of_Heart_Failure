# Data Processing and Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on data processing and analysis for predicting heart failure outcomes. The notebook includes steps for loading, cleaning, and analyzing the dataset, as well as visualizations to interpret the results.

## Steps in the Notebook

1. **Loading the Data**  
   - Imported the dataset using `pandas`.  
   - Verified the structure and checked for missing values or anomalies. 

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates using `pandas.DataFrame.duplicated()`.  
   - Handled missing values by imputing or dropping rows/columns.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized data distributions using histograms and box plots.  
   - Checked correlations between features using a heatmap.  

4. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Applied a **t-test** to compare means of different groups within the dataset.  
     \[
     t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
     \]  
   - Evaluated p-values to determine statistical significance.

5. **Figures**  
   - Key visualizations include:  
     - A histogram of feature distributions.
     - A correlation heatmap.
     - Box plots to highlight outliers.

   Example:  
   ![Histogram](path/to/histogram.png)  
   ![Heatmap](path/to/heatmap.png)

6. **Processed Data**  
   - Saved the cleaned and preprocessed data as a new CSV file for further analysis or modeling.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:  
  - `pandas`

### Embedding Figures
To include figures in your `README.md`, save them from your notebook using `matplotlib` or your visualization tool, then reference them as shown below:
```markdown
![Figure Title](path/to/figure.png)
```
