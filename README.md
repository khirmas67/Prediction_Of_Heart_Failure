## **Overview**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model, KNN Classification, that predicts the risk of heart failure using patient data. The project focuses on helping **pharmaceutical companies** identify patients who are most likely to benefit from specific treatments or participate in clinical trials. If the right individuals are identified, then pharmaceutical companies can smooth clinical trials, optimize drug development, and enhance the effectiveness of the new treatments.



## **Business Case: Pharmaceutical Industry**
In the pharmaceutical industry, **identifying target patients** plays an important role in ensuring the success of clinical trials and drug treatments. The machine learning model  used in this project offers several benefits for the industry: 
1. Improve the selection of candidates for clinical trials.
2. Selection of right candidates reduces time and cost of the trials.
3. Increases treatment efficiency.

```
## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). It contains **299 samples** with **13 clinical features**, including:
- Age  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Serum cholesterol  
- Maximum heart rate achieved  
- ST depression induced by exercise  
- Slope of the ST segment  
- Presence of chest pain  
- Whether the patient has diabetes or hypertension

The **target variable** indicates whether heart failure was detected (binary: No = 0, Yes = 1).

## **How to Run the Project**
