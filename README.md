## **Overview**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the risk of heart failure using patient data



## **Business Case: Pharmaceutical Industry**



## **Project Structure**
The project Structure is as follows:
```bash
Prediction_Of_Heart_Failure/
├── data/
│   ├── processed/            # Folder for processed data
│   ├── raw/                  # Folder for raw data
│   └── SQL/                  # Folder for tables
├── experiments/              # Jupyter notebooks for experiments and EDA
├── models/                   # Trained models 
├── reports/                  # Visualizations, evaluation reports from EDA and model performance
├── README.md                 # Project overview and instructions (this file)
├── requirements.txt          # List of dependencies
└── src/                      # Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation

```
## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). It contains **299 samples** with **13 clinical features**, including:
- Age  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Serum cholesterol  
- Maximum heart rate achieved  
- ST depression induced by exercise  
- Slope of the ST segment  
- Presence of chest pain  
- Whether the patient has diabetes or hypertension

The **target variable** indicates whether heart failure was detected (binary: No = 0, Yes = 1).






## **How to Run the Project**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/khirmas67/Prediction_Of_Heart_Failure.git)
   cd Prediction_Of_Heart_Failure
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```
