## **Overview**
The purpose of this project is to develop a KNN classification model to predict heart failure risk using patient data. It helps **pharmaceutical companies** identify patients who are likely to benefit from specific treatments or be part of the  clinical trials. Identifying the right patients can make trials run smoothly, improve drug development, and increase the effectiveness of new treatments.



## **Business Case: Pharmaceutical Industry**
In the pharmaceutical industry, **identifying target patients** is very important for the success of clinical trials and drug treatments. The machine learning model in this project provides several benefits:  
1. Improves candidate selection for clinical trials.  
2. Reduces trial time and costs by selecting the right participants.  
3. Enhances treatment effectiveness.

```
## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). It contains **918 samples** with **11 clinical features**, including:
- Age  
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure  
- Serum cholesterol  
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiogram
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise Angina
- ST depression(OldPeak)
- Slope of the ST segment  

The **target variable (HeartDisease** indicates whether heart failure was detected (binary: No = 0, Yes = 1).

## **How to Run the Project**
