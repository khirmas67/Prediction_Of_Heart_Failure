## **Overview**
This project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting heart failure risk using patient clinical data, then choose the one with the best performance metrics. The candidate algorithms to develop these models are:  K-Nearest Neighbors , Random Forest ,  Logistic Regression and  Neural Network.  Such predictions can assist pharmaceutical companies in optimizing clinical trial participant selection and improving treatment effectiveness.


 
## **Business Case: Pharmaceutical Industry**
In the pharmaceutical industry, **identifying target patients** is very important for the success of clinical trials and drug treatments. The machine learning model in this project provides several benefits:  
1. Improves candidate selection for clinical trials.  
2. Reduces trial time and costs by selecting the right participants.  
3. Enhances treatment effectiveness.

```
## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). It contains **918 samples** with **11 clinical features**, including:
- Age  
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure  
- Serum cholesterol  
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiogram
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise Angina
- ST depression(OldPeak)
- Slope of the ST segment  

The distribution of numerical features with respect to the target variable (HeartDisease) is shown in the figure below:

The distribution of numerical features with respect to the target variable (HeartDisease) is shown in the figure below:![heart_disease__categorical_features_analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7796aa0f-40e2-43d8-88b8-8f6923c9b265)

The **target variable (HeartDisease** indicates whether heart failure was detected (binary: No = 0, Yes = 1).
The pie chart below represents the distribution of heart disease and no heart disease cases in the dataset. It shows shows that approximately 55.3% of the cases in the dataset have heart disease, while 44.7% do not
